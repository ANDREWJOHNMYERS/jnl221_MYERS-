			<h2>Changing Climate</h2>

			<h3>The Lay Down</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<p>In early March, Syracuse, NY, broke its warmest temperature mark twice in a week. Before the calendar hit the month of madness, February 2024 became the warmest February ever recorded in Syracuse. 

According to the National Weather Service, the record bell rang on March 4 at 11:54 a.m. when temperatures blitzed up to 65 degrees. The previous high mark was set in 1974 at 63 degrees.

Only a day later did that record get snapped as temperatures rose to 71 degrees. With these sudden temperature spikes, is global warming finally becoming an issue in Central New York?

Global warming has been a hot potato word in many conversations about the weather, often becoming political. Many pinpoint 1988 as the first time the term was brought to light after a severe rise in global temperatures. The United States saw a steady drought in rain along with an increase in wildfires.

Cold weather climates in Syracuse often do not get the buzz around global warming until now, right? Looking at the weather in Salt City, it is glaring to see that temperatures have fluctuated throughout history, but that still does not take away from the issue of global warming and rising temperatures.

			<h3>Is it the weather or somthing more?</h3>

			<p>Examining the average low and high Syracuse January temperatures in the last 24 years shows no steady rise in the month, getting increasingly hotter. 2002 saw the average high at 31 degrees; it dropped six degrees the following year. 
				
	The hottest January recorded in the last 24 years was in 2006, with the temperature settling around 42 degrees. However, three years later, that temperature sank back down to 24 degrees. 

	In the last five years, the closest the weather has approached 40 degrees was in 2022 at 37 degrees. 

These numbers do not indicate any steady change toward global warming or climate change. Wayne Mahar, president and founder of Precision Weather Service and former Chief Meteorologist in Syracuse, explains that this is just how Mother Nature behaves.

"The weather is always, going back 20 years the weather is changing, going back 10,000 or more there were warm spells and cold spells," Mahar said.  
The cold and warm patch trends have given Central New York one of its most distinct features. 

"Look at Central New York and Finger Lakes which were formed millions of years ago by dramatic warming and then there was dramatic freezing and warming again and then you're left with finger lakes," Maher said.

The seesaw temperatures have led to geophysical features; is there concern that temperatures are getting high? Well, Maher again takes a stroll down history to explain.

"Some of the warmest weather we have ever had in 150 years of record keeping was back in the dust bowl age. In the early 20s those were the warmest temperatures we have ever had. In Syracuse for four days straight the temperature was in the 100s. Temperatures were extremely hot long before we ever heard of man made climate change," Maher said. 

It is essential to examine high-temperature spikes that occurred many years ago; Maher also points to more modern parts of history and a different kind of weather.

"Back in the 1970s the big story in the media was global cooling and that there would be another ice age which did not happen. Now the big talk is global warming," Maher said.

While history has presented a picture of consistent high heat patches and failed global cooling events, Manuela Andreoni's New York Times piece A New Era In Global Heat highlights the prominent danger of global warming and climate change. 

Andreoni's research reveals that 2023 was one of the plants' hottest years on record, and scientists fear it will only get hotter. 
"2023 foretells many more years in which heat records are not merely broken, but smashed. In other words, they are asking whether the numbers are a sign that the planet's warming is accelerating," Andreoni said. 

Human activities like population and greenhouse gasses mainly cause these accelerated increases in temperature. The man-made problems are leading to visible damage. 

"Canada has its most destructive wildfire season on record, Antarctica had the smallest amount of sea ice ever measured and unrelenting heat battered several countries including Iran, China, Greece, the United States, Malawi and Chile," Andreoni said.

Those problems occurring worldwide are not going unnoticed by meteorologists like Maher. However, he sides with the January weather history in Syracuse, where mother nature has its ups and downs. Also, other parts of the world are having climate problems for the opposite reason.

"In Siberia and Russia they are abnormally cold, the weather is balancing itself out on a global basis," Maher said.

			<h3>Consensue</h3>
			<p>Weather temperatures constantly fluctuate, and the world is going through a typical weather pattern, or there is a severe problem with the climate; the one certainty to conclude is that the climate is constantly changing.</p>
